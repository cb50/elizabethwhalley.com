A group exhibit by members of the [Atelier de l’île](https://www.atelier.qc.ca/) of Val David, Quebec.

The artists experimented with folding in their projects. I made my lightbox with folded blizzard boxes following a design invented by Hedi Kyle and Ulla Warchol. I created each step in the folding process in the accompanying panel.

The title of the lightbox, Margaree Island, refers to an island visible from Inverness Beach, Cape Breton. Sunsets at Inverness Beach inspired this piece.
