title: Winter Trees

description: Winter Trees is a series of screenprints of trees in winter that I am currently working on. The prints are inspired by pictures and texts I receive from collaborating friends and artists who have a special affinity for a particular tree. I am interested in how a tree can be a companion in a space where our everyday life takes place.
