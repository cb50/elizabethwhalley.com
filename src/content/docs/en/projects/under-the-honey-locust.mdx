In this series of lithographs, a static three-quarter portrait, familiar as a fixed emblem of identity, becomes a fluid, unstable personality transformed through the many possible iterations of a series of aluminum plates. Each plate is a drawing from life of the same face at exactly the same point of view. The intuitive process of drawing from observation renders each portrait the sensation of a unique moment. By layering the plates in various sequences and repetitions, movement and expression emerge spontaneously from the printing process itself.   The sequence of portraits is open-ended and un-fixed.
