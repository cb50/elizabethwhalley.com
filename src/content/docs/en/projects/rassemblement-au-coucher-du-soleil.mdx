_Gathering at Sunset, 2025, Acrylic on wooden panels, 12 feet x 8 feet_

Commissioned by the Municipality of Val-David, Quebec, as part of its public art collection, this mural celebrates nature, the community and creativity in Val-David.
  
This mural was inspired by the spectacle of nature that we see in the Laurentians. It also queries our typical reaction to this spectacle:  reaching for our digital cameras and capturing a moment of its ephemerality in digital images.

In response to these beautiful digital images, colours enhanced by algorithms and the light of our device’s screens, I created a  pixelated, high-keyed  image from a photo of a sunset with mountains and a lake in Val-David.  I brought together community members  to help me labouriously paint the 13,864 pixels of the image, recreating in human terms what our digital technologies do. The pixels are animated by the human touch of a group of people working together creating a variety of paint textures and colour variations. 

An Augmented Reality video, available with the Artivive app, integrates silhouettes of the creatures and humans who inhabit this Laurentian landscape and create its community.

This project, themed around networking and community, is facilitated by the Municipality of the Village of Val-David in collaboration with Atelier de l'île and the community, within the framework of the Cultural Development Agreement with the Quebec Ministry of Culture and Communications.
