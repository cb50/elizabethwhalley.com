She  was awarded a Canada Council travel grant, a McNair Scholars research grant, and a Pratt faculty grant. She has attended artist residencies in Newfoundland, California, and Montreal.  She received her MFA and an Advanced Certificate in Performance and Interactive Media Arts from Brooklyn College, City University of New York after studies at Concordia University, Montreal. She has taught at Adelphi University, Haverford College, Pratt Institute, Pont Aven School of Contemporary Art, and Brooklyn College.
