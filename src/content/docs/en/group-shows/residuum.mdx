The installation contrasts the ceaseless and changing cycle of erosion and regeneration caused by the action of the ocean on the beach  with the persistence of plastic in that environment.

A plastic projection screen created with translucent plastic waste materials such as beverage bottles, shower curtains, food containers  wraps 3 sides of a tent. A  projection of the ocean with accompanying audio creates an immersive environment which participants are invited to enter to contribute their translucent plastic waste materials to the screen.
